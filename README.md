# weather-app
React/redux app that hooks into Dark Sky API for weather information.

## Installation

Run `npm install` in the root directory to install all dependencies.

### Development

Run `node server.js` to run the express server. This is needed as DarkSky blocks any requests coming from a browser due to CORS.

In a separate command window, run `npm run start` to begin the webpack development server.

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app
